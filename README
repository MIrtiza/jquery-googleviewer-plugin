jQuery GoogleViewer is a compact jQuery plugin that allows you to automatically add Google Viewer document viewing support for links to any documents that the service supports. This includes Microsoft Word 2003 and Word 2007 documents. PDF documents, text files and more. You can easily customize which document formats you want to have updated to display in the viewer and target options can also be specified. I tried to keep this plugin quite DRY, so if theres anything important missing,ok let me know.
